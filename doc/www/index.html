<h3>What is Deputy?</h3>

<p>Deputy is a C compiler that is capable of preventing common C
programming errors, including out-of-bounds memory accesses as well as
many other common type-safety errors.  It is designed to work on
real-world code, up to and including the Linux kernel itself.</p>

<p>Deputy allows C programmers to provide simple type annotations that
describe pointer bounds and other important program invariants.  Deputy
verifies that your program adheres to these invariants through a
combination of compile-time and run-time checking.</p>

<p>Unlike other tools for checking C code, Deputy provides a flexible
annotation language that allows you to describe many common programming
idioms without changing your data structures.  As a result, using Deputy
requires less programmer effort than other tools.  In fact, code compiled
with Deputy can be linked directly with code compiled by other C
compilers, so you can choose exactly when and where to use Deputy within
your C project.</p>

<p>Deputy is implemented using the <a
href="http://hal.cs.berkeley.edu/cil/">CIL</a> infrastructure for C
program analysis and transformation.</p>

<h3>Download</h3>

<p>Deputy is currently available as a Debian package, an RPM, or a source
distribution:</p>

<ul>
<li>Debian: <a href="deputy_1.1-1_i386.deb">deputy_1.1-1_i386.deb</a></li>
<li>RPM: <a href="deputy-1.1-1.i386.rpm">deputy-1.1-1.i386.rpm</a></li>
<li>Source: <a href="deputy-1.1.tar.gz">deputy-1.1.tar.gz</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you choose to download the source distribution, you will need the <a
href="http://caml.inria.fr/">OCaml compiler</a> to build Deputy.</p>

<p>Deputy is currently being developed for Linux and Cygwin on x86
processors.  Other platforms and processors should work as well but may
require additional effort to build.  (Please feel free to <a
href="mailto:deputy@deputy.cs.berkeley.edu">submit</a> comments and/or
patches for other platforms!)</p>
